      <h3>
        2019-24: <a href="https://bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> - Online Music
        Platform
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ruby / MySQL / Linux / Cypress / Web</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Bandcamp is an online 'fair trade' music store that processed $200+
        million in sales in the last year.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was a senior developer on the Growth team and also built tools for the
        Support team. My team recently built the slick new mobile web
        interface, but my favourite technical accomplishments are probably the
        numerous significant performance improvements I found across many
        highly-trafficked pages and in gnarly legacy code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wrote new tools to measure, test, and verify the pages my team was
        responsible for. I implemented SEO fixes, measured their effect, and
        advised other teams about search engines and performance, using my
        know-how from previous jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the Support side, I migrated the team to HelpScout and sped up
        their workflows with automations, shortcuts, and new admin pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also added an easter egg to the purchase dialog which goes viral
        every now and again.
      </p>
      <h3>
        2009-19:
        <a href="https://www.bouncycastlenetwork.com">Bouncy Castle Network</a>
        - Online Booking System
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>ASP.Net / C#, MVC, MSSQL / Entity Framework</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I was the technical lead and senior developer for an online booking
        system and website provider for the party hire industry, growing from
        1 to 1,200 customers across the UK and internationally and processing
        6,700+ bookings per day at the peak of the season.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was the public face of the software side of the business from its
        inception, working to support the existing client base through new
        features while adopting a sales role to bring in new registrations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way I trained new staff members on support, mentored junior
        developers, wrote tutorials, hosted marketing seminars, cultivated an
        online community of hirers, and built an advanced internal CRM to
        allow the business to double in turnover each year to £1m in 2018.
      </p>
      <h3>2012+: Freelancing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Jekyll, Eleventy, Git, Linux</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I build and host my favourite curry cafe's
        <a href="https://thisandthatcafe.co.uk/">website</a> and manage
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThisAndThatManchester">their
          social media.</a>
        Nothing too massive, but I get free curry from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm 'the web guy' for my friends and family and host a bunch of sites
        for them, and I manage
        <a href="https://veganprestwich.co.uk">a local vegan food
          recommendations website</a>
        with my wife.
      </p>
      <h3>2010-12: Metro Salvage - Vehicle Recycling Firm</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          ASP.Net / C#, MSSQL, PHP, Wordpress, Joomla, Magento, IIS / Windows
          Server, Photoshop
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I was the sole developer at one of the North West's largest vehicle
        recycling yards, creating an intranet and online system to sell leads
        and parts to other recyclers around the UK through a network of
        websites and widgets. The system was generating £200k+ of new income
        after year one.
      </p>
      <h3>2007-10: Reach BCS - Web Agency</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Classic ASP, VB, ASP.Net / C#, SQL, Access, PHP, HTML, CSS</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I joined as a copywriter but soon adopted an internal security role
        (read: breaking everyone else's code), finally ending as a full-stack
        developer. I built custom e-commerce systems, scrapers, image
        generators, CMS systems, blogs, directories, and internal business
        automation tools.
      </p>
      <h3>2004-7: Lancaster University, Linguistics</h3>
      <p>
        I gained infamy within the IT department for routing around the
        firewall and facilitating mass file-sharing, resulting in meetings
        with the dean. I've since forgotten everything I learned about
        Linguistics.
      </p>
      <h3>2000+: Recreational Programming</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Linux, Docker, Git, Nix, DNS</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I host my own '<a href="https://stefn.co.uk/setup">private cloud</a>'
        in NixOS and Debian, which takes a lot of tinkering. Programming is a
        hobby to me as well as a career - I find it therapeutic to get my
        headphones on, turn up some good tunes, and get stuck into building
        something awesome. Having said that, I once had a nightmare about
        Scala.

    <h2>Me</h2>
    <p>
      I live with my wife and dog in the suburbs of Manchester. I spend my free
      time listening to very heavy metal music, headbanging at concerts, eating
      out, keeping healthy, noodling on instruments, and playing video games.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks for considering me!
